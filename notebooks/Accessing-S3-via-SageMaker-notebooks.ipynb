    "- Read data directly from an S3 bucket into memory in a SageMaker notebook.\n",

    "## Initial setup \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open .ipynb notebook\n",
    "Once your newly created *instance* shows as `InService`, open the instance in Jupyter Lab. From there, we can create as many Jupyter notebooks as we would like within the instance environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then select the standard python3 environment (conda_python3) to start our first .ipynb notebook (Jupyter notebook). We can use the standard conda_python3 environment since we aren't doing any training/tuning just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After opening, you can right-click the Jupyter notebook name to \"Rename\" it to: `Interacting-with-S3.ipynb`, since interacting with S3 will be our focus for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set up AWS environment\n",
    "To begin each notebook, it's important to set up an AWS environment that will allow seamless access to the necessary cloud resources. Here's what we'll do to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Role**: We'll use `get_execution_role()` to retrieve the IAM role associated with the SageMaker instance. This role specifies the permissions needed for interacting with AWS services like S3, which allows SageMaker to securely read from and write to storage buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the SageMaker Session**: Next, we'll create a `sagemaker.Session()` object, which will help manage and track the resources and operations we use in SageMaker, such as training jobs and model artifacts. The session acts as a bridge between the SageMaker SDK commands in our notebook and AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up an S3 Client using boto3**: Using `boto3`, we'll initialize an S3 client for accessing S3 buckets directly. Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python, allowing developers to interact programmatically with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with these initializations prepares our notebook environment to efficiently interact with AWS resources for model development, data management, and deployment."

    "## Reading data from S3\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either (A) read data from S3 into memory or (B) download a copy of your S3 data into your notebook instance. Since we are using SageMaker notebooks as controllers—rather than performing training or tuning directly in the notebook—the best practice is to **read data directly from S3** whenever possible. However, there are cases where downloading a local copy may be useful. We'll show you both strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Reading data directly from S3 into memory  \n",
    "This is the recommended approach for most workflows. By keeping data in S3 and reading it into memory when needed, we avoid local storage constraints and ensure that our data remains accessible for SageMaker training and tuning jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Data remains in S3, allowing multiple training/tuning jobs to access it without duplication.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: No need to manage local copies or manually clean up storage.\n",
    "- **Cost-effective**: Avoids unnecessary instance storage usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network dependency**: Requires internet access to S3.\n",
    "- **Potential latency**: Reading large datasets repeatedly from S3 may introduce small delays. This approach works best if you only need to load data once or infrequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Reading data from S3 into memory\n",
    "Our data is stored on an S3 bucket called 'name-titanic-s3' (e.g., doejohn-titanic-s3). We can use the following code to read data directly from S3 into memory in the Jupyter notebook environment, without actually downloading a copy of train.csv as a local file."
