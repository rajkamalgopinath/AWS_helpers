    "#### Hyperparameter considerations in neural nets\n",
    "When tuning hyperparameters in neural networks, it's essential to prioritize parameters that directly impact model performance while remaining mindful of diminishing returns and potential overfitting. Below are some core hyperparameters to consider and general strategies for tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: Often the most impactful parameter, learning rate controls the speed of convergence. A smaller learning rate can lead to more stable, though slower, convergence, while a larger rate may speed things up but risks overshooting optimal values. Testing ranges like `0.0001` to `0.1` with a `ContinuousParameter` is common practice, and `Bayesian` search can help home in on ideal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Size**: Larger batch sizes often yield faster training times and may improve stability, but this can risk bypassing useful local minima, especially with small datasets. Smaller batch sizes can capture more nuanced updates but are computationally expensive. Ranges from `16` to `256` are worth exploring for most use cases, although, for large datasets or high-capacity models, even larger values may be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Epochs**: While larger epochs allow the model to learn from data longer, increasing epochs doesn't always equate to better performance and can lead to overfitting. Exploring `CategoricalParameter([50, 100, 500, 1000])` can help balance performance without excessive training costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layer Width and Depth**: Increasing the width or depth (i.e., number of neurons and layers) can improve model capacity but also risks overfitting if the dataset is small or lacks variability. Testing a range of layer sizes or depths (e.g., `32, 64, 128` neurons per layer) can reveal whether additional complexity yields benefits. Notably, understanding *double descent* is essential here, as larger networks may initially seem to overfit before unexpectedly improving in the *second descent*—a phenomenon worth investigating in high-capacity networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameters**: Regularization techniques, such as dropout rates or weight decay, can help control overfitting by limiting model capacity. For example, dropout rates from `0.1` to `0.5` or weight decay values of `0.0001` to `0.01` often balance underfitting and overfitting effectively. Higher regularization might inhibit learning, especially if the model is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**: While not a traditional hyperparameter, setting up early stopping based on the validation performance can prevent overfitting without the need to exhaustively test for epoch limits. By allowing the model to halt once performance plateaus or worsens, early stopping can improve efficiency in hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Phenomena - Grokking and Double Descent**: For certain complex datasets or when tuning particularly large models, keep an eye on phenomena like *grokking* (sudden shifts from poor to excellent generalization) and *double descent* (an unexpected second drop in error after initial overfitting). These behaviors are more likely to appear in models with high capacity and prolonged training periods, potentially requiring longer epochs or lower learning rates to observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, hyperparameter tuning is a balancing act between expanding model capacity and mitigating overfitting. Prioritize parameters that have shown past efficacy in similar problems, and limit the search to a manageable range—often 20–30 model configurations are sufficient to observe gains. This approach keeps resource consumption practical while achieving meaningful improvements in model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Set up HyperParamterTuner object\n",
    "In step 3, we set up the `HyperparameterTuner`, which controls the tuning process by specifying the...\n",
    "\n",
    "- `estimator`: Here, we connect the previously defined `pytorch_estimator` to `tuner`, ensuring that the tuning job will run with our PyTorch model configuration.\n",
    "- `objectives`:\n",
    "- The `metric_definitions` and `objective_metric_name` indicate which metric SageMaker should monitor to find the best-performing model; in this case, we’re tracking \"validation:accuracy\" and aiming to maximize it. We'll show you how to setup your training script to report this information in the next step.\n",
    "- `hyperparameter ranges`: Defined above.\n",
    "- `tuning strategy`: SageMaker uses a **Bayesian strategy** by default, which iteratively improves parameter selection based on past performance to find an optimal model more efficiently. Although it’s possible to adjust to a \"Random\" strategy, Bayesian optimization generally provides better results, so it’s recommended to keep this setting. \n",
    "- `max_jobs` and `max_parallel_jobs`: Finally, we set `max_jobs` to control the total number of configurations SageMaker will explore and `max_parallel_jobs` to limit the number of jobs that run simultaneously, balancing resource usage and tuning speed. Since SageMaker tests different hyperparameter values dynamically, it's important to limit total parallel instances to <= 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Resource-Conscious Approach**: To control costs and energy-needs, choose efficient instance types and limit the search to impactful parameters at a sensible range, keeping resource consumption in check. Hyperparameter tuning often does yield better performing models, but these gains can be marginal after exhausting a reasonable search window of 20-30 model configurations. As a researcher, it's also imortant to do some digging on past work to see which parameters may be worthwhile to explore. Make sure you understand what each parameter is doing before you adjust them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Always start with `max_jobs = 1` and `max_parallel_jobs=1`.**\n",
    "Before running the full search, let's test our setup by setting max_jobs = 1. This will test just one possible hyperparameter configuration. This critical step helps ensure our code is functional before attempting to scale up."

It may be a little counter-intuitive that printing can slow things down so dramatically, but it truly does become a significant factor if you're doing it every epoch. On the flipside of this, you don't want to print metrics so infrequently that you lose resolution in the monitored validation accuracy. Choose a number between 100-1000 epochs or divide your total epoch count by ~25 to yield a reasonable range."

We then call `tuner.fit` and pass a dictionary mapping each data channel (\"train\" and \"val\") to its respective path. This command initiates the tuning job, triggering SageMaker to begin sampling hyperparameter combinations, training the model, and evaluating performance based on our defined objective metric.

With two jobs running at once, SageMaker will be able to explore potential improvements more quickly than in a fully sequential setup, while still dynamically selecting promising values as it learns from completed jobs. This balance leverages SageMaker’s Bayesian optimization, which uses completed trials to inform subsequent ones, helping to avoid redundant testing of less promising parameter combinations. **Setting `max_parallel_jobs` higher than 2-4 could increase costs and reduce tuning efficiency, as SageMaker’s ability to learn from completed jobs decreases when too many jobs run simultaneously.**\n",

This approach won’t affect the total cost (since cost is based on the number of total jobs, not how many run concurrently), but it can impact the final results and resource usage pattern due to SageMaker's ability to dynamically select hyperparameter values to test to maximize efficiency and improve model performance. This adaptability is especially useful for neural networks, which often have a large hyperparameter space with complex interactions. Here’s how SageMaker’s approach impacts typical neural network training:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Adaptive Search Strategies\n",
    "   - SageMaker offers **Bayesian optimization** for hyperparameter tuning. Instead of purely random sampling, it learns from previous jobs to choose the next set of hyperparameters more likely to improve the objective metric.\n",
    "   - For neural networks, this strategy can help converge on better-performing configurations faster by favoring promising areas of the hyperparameter space and discarding poor ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Effect of `max_parallel_jobs` on adaptive tuning\n",
    "   - When using Bayesian optimization, a lower `max_parallel_jobs` (e.g., 2–4) can allow SageMaker to iteratively adjust and improve its choices. Each batch of jobs informs the subsequent batch, which may yield better results over time.\n",
    "   - Conversely, if all jobs are run in parallel (e.g., `max_parallel_jobs=20`), SageMaker can’t learn and adapt within a single batch, making this setup more like a traditional grid or random search. This approach is still valid, especially for small search spaces, but it doesn’t leverage the full potential of adaptive tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Practical impact on neural network training\n",
    "   - **For simpler models** or smaller parameter ranges, running jobs in parallel with a higher `max_parallel_jobs` works well and quickly completes the search.\n",
    "   - **For more complex neural networks** or large hyperparameter spaces, an adaptive strategy with a smaller `max_parallel_jobs` may yield a better model with fewer total jobs by fine-tuning hyperparameters over multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- **For fast, straightforward tuning**: Set `max_parallel_jobs` closer to `max_jobs` for simultaneous testing.\n",
    "- **For adaptive, refined tuning**: Use a smaller `max_parallel_jobs` (like 2–4) to let SageMaker leverage adaptive tuning for optimal configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This balance between exploration and exploitation is particularly impactful in neural network tuning, where training costs can be high and parameters interact in complex ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting and evaluating the best model after tuning\n",
    "\n",

After SageMaker completes the hyperparameter tuning job, the results, including the trained models for each configuration, are stored in an S3 bucket.
